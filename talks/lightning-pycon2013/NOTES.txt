* More coverage with Instrumental

* Agenda:
  - coverage.py
  - structural coverage basics
  - intrumental - what and how

* How many people know about / have used coverage.py?
  - Great!
  - You know that coverage.py provides statement coverage and branch coverage
    - Statement coverage tells you which statements are and aren't executed
    - Branch coverage tells you which branches you have and haven't taken
    - Basic structural coverage
    - Gives you a good sense for what you have and haven't tested.
      - Particularly for Python code
      - If it isn't executed it may explode

* Programs are more than statements and branches
  - They also contain conditions and decisions
    - condition: atomic boolean expression (cannot be broken down)
    - decision: bool expression of conditions w/zero or more bool operators
  - Decisions often represent more complex logic
    - Not just "if this: do that"
    - Could be "if this and that or it: do some other thing"

* Consider "a and b or c"
  - 5 significant cases - reasons why it was T or F
    - (T T) F
    - (F *) F
    - (T F) F
    - ( F ) T
    - ( F ) F
  - Significant because they isolate the effects of certain inputs' truthiness
  - Achieve full branch coverage by executing 2
  - Miss 3 cases

* Enter Instrumental
  - Instrumental measures these things
  - Let's look at an example:
  - Running Instrumental against pyramid code (for example) looks like this:
    - "-t" target the package "pyramid"
    - "-i" ignore the pyramid.tests package
    - "-r" show me a report containing constructs with missed coverage
    - `<stuff>` path to a python script to run
  - Report looks like this:
    ...

* More than just tests in control flow
  - Measures coverage in assignments
  
* Neat stuff
  - Doesn't expect you to execute cases that are obviously unreachable
    - "foo or {}" obviously can't be (F T)
  - pragmas allow you to specify unreachable cases
    - pragma: no cond(T F)

* Also:
  - supports / committed to supporting:
    - Statement coverage
    - Cobertura compatible XML output
    - HTML output with missed coverage highlighted
